# Team-Profile-Generator

This application creates a team roaster with basic information from given user input. When this application is under run, a series of questions is displayed in the terminal window asking for specific information about a team of employees. First, the user needs to type manager information. That is why the code is asking manager questions first. Second, the user can add either between engineer and intern. Although the user only can put one manager, the user can select as many other team members as needed. When all the members have been added, the user can select ***"[EXIT] Quit adding"***. Then the user will see a success message: ***"You added all of your team members!"***. Then, in the output folder in the directory, an html file will be created with information of each team member. You can see the final example through the demo below or in the output folder.
